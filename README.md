**Title: Corn Leaf Disease Detection**  
**Hanif Aydin Rizky - 2155301055**

## Background
Food security is a national priority, but Indonesia's agricultural sector faces major challenges from plant disease attacks that reduce production by up to 40%. Manual control systems are ineffective due to limited experts and large agricultural areas. The advancement of digital technology, with the use of technology, opens up opportunities for the use of artificial intelligence and computer vision. The use of this technology can increase the accuracy of disease detection in plants by up to 85% and accelerate the treatment process by up to 75% and can support food security amid the challenges of climate change.

## Objective
- Help to overcome diseases in corn plants in a better way.
- Develop a leaf image-based detection system.
- Simplify and speed up the process of recognizing diseases in corn plants.

## Dataset Used
- Dataset: “New Plant Diseases Dataset” by SAMIR BHATTARA (from Kaggle).
- Focus: dataset for corn leaves.

## Implementation Process
1. Take an image of a corn leaf.
2. The image is processed by the model.
3. Detection results are displayed, along with disease type explanation and treatment suggestions.
